Script access to current step.timeout-minutes

Hi. In a job step i set "timeout-minutes" to a given value, say 60 minutes.
After in the same step i run a script that will be safely killed before the 60 minutes.
To safely kill the script i need to get the value of "timeout-minutes".
Is there any way to get the value?
